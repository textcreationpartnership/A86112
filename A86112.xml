            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         </projectDesc>
         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

That as Sir <hi>John Davis</hi> in his preface, there is no art nor ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence which ſtandeth upon diſcourſe and reaſon, which hath her Rules and Maxims ſo certaine and infallible, and ſo little ſubject to diverſe interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations as the common Law of <hi>England.</hi> Whence Sir <hi>Edw.

                  <p>It is a Maxime in the Law, that no diſtreſſes can be taken that are not put into certainty, nor can be reduced to any certainty, for, <hi>id certum eſt, quod certum reddi poteſt,</hi> as the Lord cannot diſtraine them which hold their Tenements in Frankalmoine, if they will not doe ſuch divine ſervice, becauſe it is not put in certaine what ſervice they ſhall do, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can it bee reduced to a certainty, for upon an avowry damages cannot bee recovered, for that which neither hath certainty, neither can bee redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to any certainty, and yet in ſome caſes there may bee a certainty in uncertainty.

                  <p>So if the heire will pleade in bar in a writ of Dower, the detainer of evidences, he muſt ſhew the certainty of the evidencies, for he is privy to them in that he affirmeth that they appertaine to him, but if he ſay a bag enſealed with Charters, that is good without ſhewing the certainty of them, 18. <hi>H.</hi> 8. <hi>f.</hi> 1. <hi>B.</hi> Dower.</p>

The Plaintiff in an action of debt counts that the Defendant retained him in his ſervice for eight years, to ſerve him in all occupations, taking for every yeare 20 s. and the Defendant gageth his Law, and though the Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiff was retained in husbandry, and the ſervice of husbandry was implyed in the words all occupations, yet the Defendant was received to his Law, becauſe it was not fully expreſſed that he was retained in husbandry, but onely by implication, which would not ſuffice, So <hi>Ployd. f.</hi> 143. <hi>b.</hi> The Covenant in the Indenture was, if one moyety of the Rent was behinde and unpaid after two moneths ſince the Feaſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that then, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and in the rejoynder it

                  <p>Every Recovery had in our Law muſt be pleaded certainly to every intent, <hi>Ployd.</hi> 65. <hi>a.</hi> as in 22. <hi>E.</hi> 4. <hi>f.</hi> 8. in a <hi>Scire facias</hi> to have execution of two hundred Acres of Land, the Tenant pleaded that ſince the <hi>Scire facias</hi> ſued that <hi>I.

                  <p>If a Bar hath matter of ſubſtance, and is good to a common intent, it ſhall ſuffice, although it be not good to every ſpeciall intent, <hi>Ployd.

<pb n="165" facs="tcp:170097:98"/> aſcend, wherein the civill law unnaturally differeth from the common law, for the civill law alloweth lineall aſcention as well as lineall deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, lineall and collaterall deſcent, but not lineal aſcention of inheritances as it doth, which, as <hi>Coke,</hi> is one of the cauſes of ſuch diverſities of opinions in caſes of deſcents in the civill law, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary is one of the cauſes of the certainty of the rules of the common law in caſes of deſcent &amp; inheritance. <hi>Coke l.</hi> 3. <hi>f</hi> 49. <hi>b.</hi>

<pb n="167" facs="tcp:170097:99"/> the debt is not the debt of the executor, but of the teſtator, and is charged in anothers right, and hath the goods in anothers right, whereas when the heire denieth aſſets <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and it is found that he hath aſſets, the debt of his Anceſtor is become his debt, in reſpect of the aſſets which he hath in his owne right, and ſo the property which he hath in his own right of the land, maketh the debt his own proper debt, and for that reaſon the writ ſhall be in the <hi>debet</hi> and <hi>detinet,</hi> and the Plaintiff may have exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution by <hi>elegit</hi> of the moiety of all his Lands, as a <hi>fieri facias</hi> of his goods, <hi>Ployd. ibidem f.</hi> 441.

<pb n="180" facs="tcp:170097:106"/> to be ſeiſed, and in antient time the limita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in a Writ of right was from the time of <hi>H.</hi> 1. after that by the Statute of <hi>Merton</hi> the limitation was from the time of <hi>Henry</hi> the ſecond, and by the Statute of <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> the firſt, the limitation was from the time of <hi>Richard</hi> the firſt, but becauſe that limitation of the writ of right was for ſo long time paſſed, the limitation of a writ of right was changed by the Statute of 32. <hi>H.</hi> 8. and reduced to threeſcore years next before the Teſte of the Writ, and ſo of other actions, <hi>Coke com. f.</hi> 115. <hi>a. vide ibidem plura.</hi> And afterwards another Act was made, 21. <hi>Jacob.</hi> that for the avoiding of ſuits, all writs of <hi>Formedon</hi> in <hi>Deſcender, Formedon</hi> in Remainder, and <hi>Forme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> in Reverter for any Mannors, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſhall be ſued and taken within twenty years, and that after the twenty years expired none ſuch, or any of their heires ſhall have any ſuch writ, and that no perſon that hath right or title of entry into any Mannors, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſhall thereunto enter but within twenty years, <hi>vide ibidem, cap.</hi> 6. <hi>plura</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But it is to be obſerved that time of limitation is twofold, firſt in writs that is by diverſe acts of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, the ſecond is to make a title of inheritance, and that is as hath been ſaid, to pleade a preſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>de tempore cujus contrarium memoria hominum non exiſtit, Coke com. f.</hi> 14. &amp; 15. which is by the common Law.</p>
                  <p>And this alſo accordeth with the rule of <hi>Bracton, Longa poſſeſſio ſicut jus parit jus poſſidendi, &amp; tollit actionem a vero domino, l.</hi> 2. <hi>f.</hi> 52. Long poſſeſſion, as right begetteth a right, and taketh away an action from the true Lord and owner.</p>
                  <p>And ſo in antient times, if the diſſeiſor had been long in poſſeſſion, the Diſſeiſee could not have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred upon him, neither could the Diſſeiſee have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred upon the Feoffee of the Diſſeiſor, if he had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued a yeare and a day in quiet poſſeſſion, and though the Law be now changed, yet at this day the Diſſeiſor dying ſeiſed, being an act in Law,
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:170097:106"/> barreth the diſſeiſee of his entrance upon the heire, and for that many advantages follow the poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and tenant, the law taketh away the entry of him that would not enter upon the Anceſtor, who is preſumed to know his title, and driveth him to his Action againſt the heire that may be ignorant thereof, <hi>Coke com. f.</hi> 237. <hi>b.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And for the above ſaid reaſon the law yieldeth diverſe utilities and advantages to the poſſeſſor, for it is better to be a poſſeſſor, then to complaine of others who are poſſeſſors, becauſe it impoſeth the burden of proving on the Plaintiff, ſo as if he can prove nothing, he which poſſeſſeth ſhall be acquit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, neither can poſſeſſion be avoided but by poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion, <hi>Ployd.</hi> 137, <hi>b.</hi> As if I make a leaſe for years of the lands of my wife and die, the leaſe is not void before entry made by the wife, for poſſeſſion muſt be avoided by poſſeſſion, and ſuch poſſeſſion muſt be gained by entry.</p>
                  <p>But if my father die, and his land deſcend to me, a Leaſe for yeares made before my entry is good, becauſe I have poſſeſſion in law, and none hath poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion in deed, but if a ſtranger abate, a leaſe made by me after is void, for the ſtranger hath poſſeſſion indeed before my entry upon him, <hi>Ployd ibid.</hi>

                  <p>So if one hath a terme for yeares, and is bound in a recogniſance or ſtatute ſtaple, and execution for non pay-ment is ſued againſt him, and the terme is extended, and a certaine annuall value delivered to the Connuſee, as it well may be (for it may bee ſold out-right, or extended to an annuall value) there the connuſee hath one property for the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his debt, and the leſſee another property, and upon the payment of the debt ſhall have the terme again.</p>

                  <p>A woman made a leaſe for yeares of mills in Kent, with exception that ſhe ſhould have the profits, and there was a great debate, whether the exception were good or no, becauſe the profits of the mills was all the benefit, and in effect the mills themſelves, but at the laſt the exception was judged good in law, and that the woman ſhould have the profits. There if ſhee enter to have the profits ſhe hath one property, and the leſſee another property, and it is incertaine how many yeares the property of the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man will continue.

                  <p>But in dignities where no poſſeſſion can be had, but ſuch as deſcendeth to a man and his heires,

                  </p>
                  <p>And as <hi>Ploydon</hi> ſaith, there is a great difference betweene lands in fee-ſimple and lands tailed, in regard of poſſeſſion, for the poſſeſſion of a brother of an eſtate taile as heire to his father, ſhall not make the ſiſter to be heire, but it ſhall deſcend to the younger ſon of the halfe venter, for he ought to have it, <hi>per formam doni, Ployd. f.</hi> 57. <hi>a.</hi>

                  <p>So if a woman ſeiſed in fee, conſent to a raviſhor, and the daughter which is <hi>proxima de ſanguine</hi> next of blood doth enter, there the ſon after borne ſhall not take away the title and poſſeſſion of the daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.

                  <p>But where the eſtate is an eſtate taile, the ſon ought to have it <hi>per formam doni:</hi> As if a feme which ſuffereth a recovery by covin, contrary to the Statute of 11. <hi>H.</hi> 7. is defeated by entry of the daughter tenant in taile, the ſon borne may enter and ouſt the daughter, for that the title in taile is in him, becauſe the ſtatute ſaith, he ſhall enjoy it according to the title, which is in taile, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the common proverb is verified, One ſhall beat the buſh, and the other have the bird.

                  <p>The intention and agreement of the mindes of the parties is the onely thing that the law reſpecteth in contracts, and ſuch words as bewray the aſſent of the parties, and have ſubſtance in them, are ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient, <hi>Ployd. f.</hi> 141.

                  <p>So a grant of an annuity to one, <hi>pro conſilio impen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dendo,</hi> is a grant conditionall, for if he will not give counſell, the annuity ſhall ceaſe, and yet there is not one word of a condition.

                  <p>If one make a Leaſe for yeares by deed, and by the ſame deed covenanteth that the Leſſee ſhall nor be impeached of waſt, that word Covenant made at the ſame time, amounteth to as much as

                  <p>So if a feoffment be made, upon condition, that if the feoffee doe not pay the Feoffor ſuch a ſumme at ſuch a day, that then the feoffor ſhall enter; If the feoffee before the day make a feoffment over, and at the day doth not pay the ſumme, there the ſecond feoffee at the day may tender and pay the ſumme, though the agreement was no other but that the

Where it is recited, that the Commons of the Realme had granted to the King a great ſubſidy of every ſack of Wooll for three yeares, in conſideration of which the King by the ſame Statute granted, that after three years nothing ſhall be taken of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, but onely the ancient cuſtome of halfe a marke of every ſack, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and that alſo by the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of 45. <hi>E.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 4. It was eſtabliſhed, that no impoſition, or charge ſhall be put on Woolls, other then the cuſtome and ſubſidy granted to the King without aſſent of Parliament, and if any were, it ſhould be repealed, and holden for nothing, but it was adjudged that the two laſt Statutes were not to diſcharge the bullion, but onely the great ſubſidies, and great charges upon Wools after the three years, and the intents of the makers of the two laſt Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes were not to diſcharge the bullion, for all things within the generall words ſhall not be taken
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:170097:120"/> as the purview of the Statute, but ſuch thing as the makers of the Statutes meant, ſo as the intent of the makers is judged by the words, and ſhall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge the generalty of them.</p>

                  <p>And this is the reaſon of the caſe in 12. <hi>H.</hi> 4. <hi>f.</hi> 21. where in debt upon an obligation againſt the heir, he pleaded that the Plaintiff was executor to Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtor (which deed he put before them) and admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtred certaine goods and Chattels to the value of the debt and more, and retained the ſame ſumme with him in the name of payment, and demanded judgement, if Action: And <hi>Hull</hi> ſaid, that if he did not retaine the ſame to himſelfe, and might have retained it, and did not, he ſhall be barred, for a man is bound to be next to himſelf, and this was the opinion of ſome of them, for which he pleaded there that he adminſtred no goods after the death of the Teſtator, <hi>vide ibidem plura,</hi> in <hi>Paramers</hi> caſe.</p>
                  <p>And for the ſame reaſon doth the law in all reciprocall acts reſpect mutuall recompence and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, for if there be no conſideration, why ſhould they be made?<note place="margin">Doct. and St.</note> and it is ſuppoſed there was error in ſuch Acts; becauſe there is no conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of profit, for every one is next unto himſelfe, <hi>&amp;

                  <p>A Nude contract is where a man maketh a bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine and ſale of his goods or lands without any recompence appointed for it: As if I ſay to you.

                  <p>And a nude promiſe is, when a man promiſeth to give a man certaine mony at ſuch a day, or to do him certaine ſervice, and nothing is aſſigned for them.</p>
                  <p>As if I promiſe to give you twenty pound to make your houſe anew, there you ſhall have no action againſt me for the 20 l. becauſe it is a nude pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, as it is affirmed by <hi>Townſend, T.</hi> 17. <hi>E.</hi> 4. <hi>Ployd. f.</hi> 308. <hi>b.</hi> So if a Carpenter by word cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanteth and undertaketh to make a new houſe, and he doth not, and for not making it, the Plaintiff bringeth an action of covenant againſt the Carpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and it doth not appeare that he had any thing for making of the houſe, it was adjudged in 11 <hi>H.</hi> 4. <hi>f.</hi> 33. that the Plaintiff ſhould not take any thing by his writ, <hi>Ployd.</hi> 309. <hi>a.</hi>

                  <p>But otherwiſe it is, if he to whom the promiſe is made, have a charge by reaſon of the promiſe, which he hath alſo performed, then in that caſe hee ſhall have an Action for that thing is promiſed.</p>
                  <p>As if a man give land in Frankal-moine, they are bound to make prayers to God for him, and in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of ſuch prayers, he is bound to pay to the cheife Lord, all the rents and ſervices iſſuing out of that land, <hi>Lit. a.</hi> Frankal.</p>

                  <p>There is <hi>jus proprietatis poſſeſſionis, &amp; poſſibilitatis,</hi> and the right of poſſibility which dependeth upon the death of a man, hath a neceſſary and common intendment, to wit, neceſſary in regard that all the iſſues of <hi>Adam</hi> muſt dye, for <hi>ſtatutum eſt omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus hominibus ſemel mori,</hi> and common, becauſe the death may happen at ſuch a time that the contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gency may take effect; and this neceſſary and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon poſſibility is called <hi>potentia propinqua,</hi> which may come into act, and is not therefore vaine, or voyd in Law; as in 15 <hi>H.</hi> 7. 10. If Lands be given to a marryed man and a marryed woman, and to the heires of their two bodies ingendred, this is a good eſtate in tail, for it is of neceſſity that death ſhall enſue; and in common poſſibility that one ſhall dye before the other, ſo as the marryage may enſue; but in the ſame caſe there ſhall not be poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility upon poſſibility: and therefore if land be given to one man and two women, there the Law ſhall not intend, that firſt he ſhall marry one, and then that ſhee that he ſhall marry ſhall dye, and
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:170097:143"/> that he ſhall eſpouſe the other, and therefore in this caſe they have ſeverall inheritances at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, as if Land be given to two barons and their femes, and the heires of their bodies engen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, in this caſe the Law ſhall not expect ſecond marriages, and therefore in this caſe they ſhall have joynt eſtates for life, and one baron and feme one moyety in tail in common, with the other ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron and feme of the other moyety, and ſo ſeverall inheritances; and with it accordeth, 24. <hi>E.</hi> 3. 29. for otherwiſe there ſhould be poſſibility upon poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, and if a man give Land to baron and feme, there is an apparent poſſibility, that they ſhall have iſſue, but if after they be divorced, <hi>cauſa prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contractus,</hi> ſo as the poſſibility is diſſolved, the Law ſhall never expect the ſecond marriage, for by the divorce they have but an eſtate of Frank-tenement, 4. <hi>H.</hi> 7. 16. 17. And a woman may enfeoff a married man, <hi>cauſa matrimonij prae locuti,</hi> for it is of neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty that death ſhall enſue, and in common poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, that the Feme of the Feoffee ſhall dye be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Feoffee: So in the common caſe of a leaſe for life, the remainder to the right heires of <hi>I.

                  </p>
                  <p>For the Law reſpecteth the right of poſſibility, and will have nothing to be void that by poſſibility may be good: As a meſnalty is given in tail, reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a rent, this is good, for the tenancy may eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheate to the donee, and then the doner ſhall di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraine for all the arrearages, 1. <hi>H.</hi> 4. 2.</p>

                  <p>But if <hi>A.</hi> be indebted to <hi>B.</hi> in two hundred pounds and delivereth goods to him to ſell to pay his debt in the beſt manner he can, and he is proferred two hundred pounds for them, and refuſeth, and after ſelleth them for an hundred pounds, <hi>A.</hi> ſhall an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer the reſidue of the debt notwithſtanding this poſſibility, 18. <hi>E.</hi> 4. 5.</p>
                  <p>But the poſſibility muſt be propinque, and a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon poſſibility, as death, or dying without iſſue, or coverture, or the like, but if it be a remote poſſibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, the Law doth judge it vaine, becauſe it ſhall not be intended by common intendement to happen, as a remainder to a corporation which is not at the time of the limitation and remainder, is void, though ſuch a corporation was after erected, during the particular eſtate, for that was <hi>potentia remota,</hi> 9. <hi>H.</hi> 6. 24. For as <hi>Ployd. f.</hi> 345. <hi>a. b.</hi> It is a principle in Law, that all gifts, be it by deviſe or otherwiſe, they ought to have a donee in <hi>eſse</hi> and not in <hi>poſſe,</hi> who hath capacity to take them given, when it ought to veſt; as deviſe of Lands in fee, and ſo of goods, if the deviſe dye before the deviſor, neither his Heire or Executor ſhall gaine any thing by this Will, <hi>vide ibidem plura,</hi> in <hi>Brets</hi> caſe.</p>
                  <p>So if a leaſe be made for life, the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to the right heires of <hi>I. S.</hi> if at the limitation of the remainder there be not any ſuch <hi>I.

And ſo in 11. <hi>E.</hi> 3. 46. the caſe was, that upon a fine levied to <hi>R.</hi> he granted, and rendred the tenements to one <hi>I.</hi> and <hi>F.</hi> his wife for their lives, the remainder to <hi>G.</hi> the Son of <hi>I.</hi> in tail, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder to the right heires of <hi>I.</hi> and at the time levied <hi>I.</hi> had not any ſon named <hi>G.</hi> but after he had iſſue named <hi>G.</hi> and in <hi>praecipe</hi> againſt <hi>F.</hi> it was adjudged that <hi>G.</hi> ſhould not take the remainder in tail becauſe he was not borne at the time of the fine levied, but long after, by which another who was right heire of <hi>I. S.</hi> was received, for when <hi>I.</hi> had not
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:170097:144"/> any ſon named <hi>G.</hi> at the time of the fine levied, the law doth not expect that he ſhal have a Son named <hi>G.</hi> after, for that is <hi>potentia remota,</hi> a remote poſſibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. But if the remainder had been limited by a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall name, as to the right heirs of <hi>I.</hi> or <hi>primogenito filio,</hi> ſuch a remainder might have been good for the common poſſibility. But if a remainder be contrary to Law, the Law ſhall never adjudge a grant good by reaſon of a poſſibility, or expectation of a thing which is contrary to Law, for that is <hi>potentia remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſſime &amp; vana,</hi> which by the intendement of the Law never cometh into act, <hi>Coke l.</hi> 2. <hi>f.</hi> 5. 2. <hi>n. b.</hi> in Sir <hi>Hugh Chomleys</hi> caſe, <hi>vide ibidem plura.</hi>

                  <p>And hereby the way may pertinently be obſerved, that a poſſibility cannot be releaſed, as if before judgement the Plaintiff in an action of debt, releaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to the baile in the Kings Bench all demands, and after judgement is given, this ſhall not bar thee to have execution againſt the baile, becauſe at the time of the releaſe he had but a meere poſſibility, and neither <hi>jus in re,</hi> or <hi>jus ad rem,</hi> but the duty is to commence after upon a contingent, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore could not be releaſed preſently.</p>
                  <p>So if the Conuſee of a Statute releaſe to the Conuſor all his right in the Land, yet afterward he may ſue execution, for he hath no right to the Land till execution, but onely a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

But if one ſell all his Fiſh in his Pond, and the Vendee dig a trench ſo as the water may run out, that by ſuch meanes he may take the Fiſh, an action of treſpaſſe will lye againſt the Vendee, becauſe he might take the Fiſh by Nets, or other Engines, but if there had been no other meanes to take them, it had been otherwiſe, and to come to the banks to fiſh he may well juſtify it, for without it he cannot take them by any meanes, ſo as a man ſhall alwayes juſtify the neceſſary circumſtance, where he hath title to the principall thing, <hi>Ployd, f.</hi> 15. &amp; 16. <hi>a. vide ibidem plura,</hi> in <hi>Renigers</hi> caſe.</p>
                  <p>So when a Leſſor in the Leaſe except the Trees and after hath an intention to ſell them, the Law giveth to him, and to thoſe who will buy them

                  <p>If tenant at will ſoweth Corne on the ground, and the Leſſor out him, he ſhall have free entry, egreſſe, and regreſſe to carry it away, for when the Law giveth any thing to any one, it giveth impli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citly whatſoever is neceſſary for the taking and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying of the ſame, and the Law driveth him not to an action for the Corne, but giveth him a ſpeedy remedy to enter into the Land, and to take, and carry it away, and compelleth not him to carry it at one time, or to carry it, before it be ready to be carryed, and if the Leſſee be diſturbed of this way the Law doth give unto him, he ſhal have his action upon the caſe and recover his damages, for when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever

                  <p>I have been too copious in the exemplification of this ground by ſo many notable caſes drawn on by the variety and curioſity of them, they being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orbitant from the beaten tract of the common Law, from which for the better effecting, and doing of right, the Law deemeth it convenient, and neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to ſwarve and deviate, and that <hi>in favorem juris et recti.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To add one example more, if an obligation be made beyond the Seas, and it beareth date at <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deaux</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> where ſhall it be ſued? anſwere is made that it may be alledged to be made in <hi>quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam loco vocato Burdeaux</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> in <hi>Iſlington</hi> in the County of <hi>Middleſex,</hi> and there ſhall it be try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, for whether there be ſuch a place in <hi>Iſlington</hi> or no, it is not traverſeable in that caſe, <hi>Coke com.</hi> 261. <hi>b.</hi>

As if a man bringeth an action upon a falſe ſurmiſe in a proper Court, he cannot bring an action againſt him, and charge him with it as a fault dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctly, and <hi>ex diametro,</hi> as if the ſuite it ſelfe was a wrongfull act, for the execution of the Law hath no injury.</p>
                  <p>So <hi>Coke com. f.</hi> 161. <hi>a.</hi> It is regularly true, that a man ſhall not be puniſhed for ſuing of Writs in the Kings Court, be it of right, or wrong, <hi>ibidem.</hi>

                  <p>And therefore 11. <hi>Eliz.</hi> a man brought a Writ of forger of falſe deeds, the Defendant though he be found guilty, could not have a <hi>ſcandalum magna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum,</hi> and lay the charge contained in the action to be the ſcandall, for no puniſhment was ever appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for a ſuite in Law, although it be falſe and upon vexation, <hi>vide Dyer f.</hi> 285. <hi>Pl.</hi> 37.</p>
                  <p>And ſo we rule it every day, that if a man be impriſoned upon a formall ſuit, though there were no juſt cauſe of ſuite, yet if he give a bond for his releaſe, he ſhall not avoid it by dureſſe, becauſe it is <hi>incarceratio legitima. Hob.</hi> 1. <hi>l.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And though every thing by nature is good, and as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, The Law is good, if a man uſe it lawfully, yet the abuſe of the Law is the fact, and therefore on the contrary part, if you charge me with a crime in a Court, that is no way cape<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able of the cauſe, I ſhall have an action for it, and lay that very complaint to be the ſlander, as <hi>Coke l.</hi> 4. <hi>f.</hi> 14. <hi>b. Wood</hi> exhibited a bill in the Star-Chamber againſt <hi>Barkeley,</hi> and <hi>inter alia,</hi> charged him that he was a maintainer of Pirates, and Murderers, <hi>&amp;c.

                  </p>
                  <p>And if a man ſue me in a proper Court, yet if his ſuite be utterly without ground of truth, and that certainely known to himſelfe, and thus as the Civilians, it be done <hi>animo injuriandi,</hi> I may have an action upon the caſe againſt him for the undue vexation, and damage that he putteth me unto by his ill practiſe, though the ſuite it ſelfe be legall, but I cannot complaine of it as it is a
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:170097:150"/> ſuite, and therefore the ſixteenth of <hi>E.</hi> 3. <hi>Fitz. de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipt,</hi> 35. A Conuſee of a Statute ſued execution a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his deed of defeaſance, whereupon the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuſor had an action of deceipt againſt him, and his Aſſignee, in the nature of an <hi>Audita querela,</hi> yet though he was impriſoned upon the Statute, could he not bring an action of falſe impriſonment, if he had paid the mony before the day limited by the defeaſance, becauſe he was impriſoned by courſe of Law, 43 <hi>E.</hi> 3.33.</p>
                  <p>And if a man ſue me, and hanging that ſuite, commenceth another againſt me, to this I have a Plea in abatement, which proveth this latter ſuite unjuſt and vexatious, but if he diſcontinue the former he may bring a new action, 43. <hi>E.</hi> 3. for as <hi>Coke com. f.</hi> 130. <hi>a.</hi> It may be he hath miſtaken ſome thing in that action, or was not provided of his proofes, or miſtaking the day, or the like.</p>
                  <p>Likewiſe I hold I may have an action of the caſe againſt him, who ſueth me againſt his releaſe, or after mony duly paid, yea though it be upon a ſingle obligation, <hi>Hob. ibidem.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But in theſe caſes, theſe two cautions are to be obſerved, that the new action be not brought before the other be determined, becauſe till then it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not appeare that the other was unjuſt, 2. <hi>R.</hi> 1. And for this reaſon a Writ of conſpiracy lyeth not untill the Plaintiff is acquitted.</p>
                  <p>The other is, that beſides the thing done amiſſe, there muſt alſo be a damage either already ſuffered, or elſe inevitable, and therefore 19. <hi>H.</hi> 6.44. If a man forge a bond in my name, I can have no action of the caſe yet, but if I be ſued I may, for the wrong or damage, though I may avoid it by Plea, but if it were upon a recognizance or fine, I ſhall have a deceit preſently before execution, for <hi>Quae inconti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nente aut certo fiunt in eſſe videntur,</hi> and 43. <hi>E.</hi> 3. 10. deceit againſt one who procured a Formedon, by colluſion, <hi>vide ibidem plura</hi> in <hi>Waterers</hi> caſe.

                  <p>And malice in homicide altereth the Law in thoſe are of full age, as mans ſlaughter is a fact leſſe hainous, becauſe it is done on a ſuddaine without malice precedent, as if two of a ſuddaine fight to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether without precogitated malice, and after many blowes given, the one flyeth from the other, and the other goeth in the next houſe for a weapon, and incontinently purſueth and killeth him that flyeth, this is but man ſlaughter by the common Law, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was done in a continuall fury, and ſhall have his Clergy, but ſhall forfeite his goods, <hi>Cromp.

                  <p>So it is if one kill another upon malice implyed, which is when one killeth another without any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence on the part of the other, as a Goaler had ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice to a priſoner in his cuſtody, becauſe he ſuſpected he was too familiar with his wife, and the priſoner purpoſing to goe out of priſon, as he was wont, for

                  <p>As the Law maketh a difference between killing a man upon malice fore-thought, and upon preſent heat, but if I give a man ſlanderous words, whereby I damnify him in his fame, and good name, it is not materiall whether I uſe them upon ſuddaine choler and provocation, or of ſet malice, but in an action upon the caſe I ſhall render damages alike.</p>

                  <p>So if a Chyrurgion authorized to practiſe, do, through negligence of his cure, cauſe the party to dye, this Chyrurgion ſhall not be queſtioned for his life: yet if he do onely hurt the Wound, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the cure is caſt back, and death enſueth not, he is ſubject to an Action of the Caſe for it, <hi>Stanf.</hi> 16.</p>

                  <p>So in Felony, if the principall dye, or be pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the proceeding againſt the acceſſory faileth.

                  <p>That the Writ of Champerty doth not lye, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it ſhall not be intended that the Bargain was made for ſuch cauſe, and that by equity, for when he bargained and promiſed the land upon juſt conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, before any action brought againſt him, it was his act to perform it notwithſtanding the action</p>
                  <p>And <hi>Coſtle</hi> promoter of the King, brought an acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Extortion. <hi>H.</hi> 21. <hi>H.</hi> 7. 16. againſt an under-Sheriff grounded upon the Statute of 23 <hi>H.</hi> 6. <hi>c.</hi> 10. which ordaineth, that neither the Sheriff, Goaler, or Miniſters, nor any of them by colour of their Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice ſhall take any thing, profit, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of any perſon for fine, fee or eaſe of priſon, but for the Sheriff 20 <hi>d.</hi> the Bayliff 4 <hi>d.</hi> and the Goaler 4 <hi>d.</hi> ſuppoſing that he had taken 20 <hi>d.</hi> above the ſame limited upon the Statute<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and upon demurrer it appeared upon evidence to the

                  <p>So the Statute of <hi>W.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 4. ordaineth that where a man, rat, or dog, eſcapeth alive out of a Ship, neither the Ship nor any thing that is within it ſhall be adjudged wrack, but all the things ſhall be ſaved, and kept by the view of the Sheriff, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in the hands of thoſe of the Towne where the things were found: ſo that if any one can prove that they are his within a yeare and a day, they ſhall be reſtored to him; and whoſoever doth other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe ſhall be awarded to priſon, and remaine at the will of the King, and render damages: yet if the goods within the Ship be ſuch things as will not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure for a yeare and a day, the Sheriff may ſell them and deliver the mony taken, for them to the Towne to anſwer for it, and that by equity, though it be againſt the words of the ſaid Act.</p>
                  <p>So the Act of 2. <hi>E.</hi> 6. <hi>c.</hi> 14. Which giveth to the King all Lands, and Tenements by any aſſurance, conveyance, given, aſſigned, or limited to find any preacher to have continuance for ever, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> if the

                  <p>There is another excellent uſe of equity which conſiſteth in guiding the grounds and maxims of of things which ſeem to croſſe, and thwart one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; for, as Sir <hi>John Doderidge,</hi>

                     </note> it is ſcarcely poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to make any ſecond rule of Law, but that it ſhall faile in ſome particular caſe, whence ſpringeth this often uſed aſſertion. <hi>Non eſt regula quin fallit,</hi> for as <hi>Cato</hi> ſaith, <hi>vix ulla lex fieri poteſt, quae omnibus commoda ſit; ſed ſi majori parti proſpiciat utilis eſt;</hi> there can ſcarce any Law be made, which ſhall fit all men, but if it provideth for the greater part it is profitable; and therefore the ordainers, and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretors of Laws, reſpect rather thoſe things which may often happen, and not every particular cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance: for the which though they would, they ſhall not be able, by any poſitive Law, to make pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion; and for the like reaſon, Mr. <hi>Ploydon</hi> ſaith, that Law is reaſonable, that provideth for the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, though that ſome perſons looſe by it, <hi>f.</hi> 369. <hi>b.</hi>

<pb n="316" facs="tcp:170097:174"/> the greateſt difficulty we finde in the arguing of our caſes; but to help this, we are to prefer thoſe, and thoſe are to prevaile that carry the more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent perfect reaſon, and equity with them; and Sir <hi>Francis Bacon</hi> ſaith, it is a point worthy to be obſerved generally in the rules of the Law, that where they encounter or croſſe one another in any caſe, it be underſtood that the Law holdeth worthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and which rules are of more equity, or humanity; but now to give you ſome examples of them, which allwayes doe illuſtrate, <hi>Coke com.</hi> 183.</p>
                  <p>It is a maxime in the Law, <hi>Quaelibet conceſſio for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſſime contra donatorem interpretanda eſt,</hi> every grant ſhall be taken moſt ſtrongly againſt himſelfe, as if Lands be letten, or a rent granted, an eſtate for life paſſeth, for that is moſt ſtrongly againſt himſelfe, which is to be underſtood that no wrong be thereby done, for there is another rule in the Civill Law, <hi>ea eſt accipienda interpretatio, quae vitio caret,</hi> and a maxime in our Law, that <hi>legis conſtructio non facie injuriam;</hi> the interpretative conſtruction of Law ſhall wrong no man; and therefore if tenant for life maketh a leaſe generally, it ſhall be taken for his own life, or elſe it ſhould worke a wrong to him in reverſion, and ſo it is if tenant in taile ſhould make a leaſe generally, for otherwiſe it ſhould worke a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>continuance, and a wrong, <hi>vide ibidem.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So if tenant in fee maketh a leaſe for life, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out mentioning for whoſe life, it ſhall be deemed for the life of the Leſſee, and ſhall be taken more ſtrongly againſt the Leſſor, but if tenant entaile maketh ſuch a leaſe for life without expreſſing for whoſe life, this ſhall be taken for the life of the Leſſor, becauſe otherwiſe it would work a wrong, <hi>Coke Com. f.</hi> 42. <hi>a.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So if an Executor grant all his Goods and Chat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tells, the goods which he hath as Executor will not paſſe, becauſe it may be a deveſtation and a wrong, yet againſt the treſpaſſor he ſhall declare, <hi>quod bona ſua cepit,</hi> 10. <hi>E.</hi> 4.1.</p>

                  <p>It is a ground, <hi>qui male agit odit lucem,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Law countenanceth more things done in the day, then in the night, as the party hath all the day till night to pay his rent, and if it be a great ſum he muſt be ready as long before the Sun ſet as the mony may be told; for the other, is not bound to tell it in the night, and a man muſt not diſtraine in the night time for rent behind, yet is there another ground in the Law, <hi>quod neceſſarium, eſt lici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum,</hi> and therefore when there is a neceſſity of doing things, they may be done in the night time, as an arbitrement made, and delivered in writing the laſt day after the Sun ſet is good enough, for judgements, and arbitrements require long advice, ſo may goods be diſtrained for in the night for damage feaſant, and a man may be arreſted in the night, for other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe peradventure he ſhall not doe it at all.</p>
                  <p>It is a ground in the Law, <hi>nihil agit in ſeipſum,</hi> no man can doe an act to himſelf, yet if one of the Chapter enfeoff the Deane and Chapter, by that he he himſelfe ſhall take by his own livery, becauſe the Law in that caſe cannot doe otherwiſe; ſo a feme tenant in Socage may endow her ſelfe, and an Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutor pay himſelfe.</p>

                  <p>It is a ground in the Law, <hi>certa debet eſse natratio</hi> counts and declarations muſt be certaine, yet things which containe a neceſſary implication are good enough, for it is another ground, <hi>non refert quid ex aequipollentibus fiat,</hi> it mattereth not what is done by equippollent, or words which amount to ſuch a ſenſe, as in an <hi>Ejectione firmae, &amp;c.</hi> In a count of a leaſe made by tenant for life, it ſufficeth to ſay that the Leſſor is yet ſeiſed without the alledging of his life expreſly, becauſe it amounteth to the ſame ſenſe by neceſſary implication.</p>

<pb n="400" facs="tcp:170097:216"/> was the firſt Statute which maketh mention of any cuſtome, and that Statute doth not give, or limit any Cuſtome to the King but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridgeth and abateth the cuſtome which was paid for Wool, or Leather; but a ſubſidy, ſaith he, is a Tax aſſeſſed by Parliament, and granted to the King by the Commoners during the life of every King only, which is made cleer by the caſe repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by <hi>Dyer,</hi> 1 <hi>Mar. f.</hi> 92. where King <hi>Edward</hi> the ſixth had granted a Licence to a Merchant ſtranger to tranſport all Merchandizes paying <hi>pro cuſtumis &amp; ſubſidiis tot, &amp; tantas denariorum ſummas, quot &amp; quantas,</hi> any engliſh Merchant and Denizen ſhould pay, and no more: And it was reſolved by all the Judges after the death of <hi>Edward</hi> the ſixth the grant was good for the Cuſtomes, but void tor the Subſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, becauſe the King had an Inheritance in the Cuſtome, as a Prorogative annexed to the Crown, but in the Subſidies he had an eſtate only for life by act of Parliament.</p>

               <p>If a man be ſeiſed of lands in Fee-ſimple, and hath iſſue two daughters, and the eldeſt is married, and the Father giveth parcell of the lands to the Baron with his Daughter in Franck-marriage, and dieth ſeiſed of the remnant, which are of the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter value by the year, then thoſe lands given in Frank-marriage: In this caſe the Baron and the Feme ſhall have nothing for their pur-party of the ſaid remnant, unleſs they will put their lands gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in Frank-marriage in hotch pot, with their rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of the land with the Siſter: And if they will not do ſo, then the younger may hold and occupy

                  <hi>Mutata legis ratione mutatar &amp; lex, Coke l.</hi> 7. <hi>f.</hi> 7. The reaſon of the Law being changed, the Law it ſelf is changed.</p>
               <p>As though by the Common Law a man cannot diſtrain for rent or ſervice in the night, 12 <hi>E.</hi> 3.17.11 <hi>H.</hi> 7.5. accord: yet for damage-feaſant a man may diſtrain in the night, for the neceſſity of the caſe, for otherwiſe peradventure he ſhall not diſtrain at all for before the day they may be taken or ſtrayed out of the ground, 10 <hi>E.</hi> 3. <hi>f</hi> 37.</p>
               <p>In the Statute of <hi>Wincheſter</hi> it is provided, that in Cities or great Villages which are incloſed, the gates ought to be ſhut from the ſetting of the Sun, to the Sun riſing; and ſince that Statute, if in ſuch Village, or City incloſed, any murther or man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlaughter be done in the day, or in the night, and the Offender eſcape, ſuch City, or Village ſhall be amerced, which Act changed the reaſon of the Law, for at the common Law, if a man was ſlain in the night, and the Offender eſcape, there it was not any default in the City and Village, but now if they do not guard their Gates ſtrongly, according to the Statute by which the Offendor eſcapeth, then it is a default and negligence in them, 3 <hi>E.</hi> 3. <hi>tit. Coronae</hi> 290.</p>
               <p>So if divers commit a robbery by the Statute of 13 E. 3. thoſe of the hundred ought to apprehend all the Felons, and though they apprehend any of them that is not ſufficient to excuſe them, for the words
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:170097:226"/> of the Act are, that they ſhall anſwer for the bodies of the Offenders: but now by the Statute of 27 <hi>Eliz. c.</hi> 13. it is provided, that none ſhall have an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction upon the ſaid ſtatute, if not, that the party rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed ſo ſoon as he can, ſhall give notice of the ſaid felony to ſome of the Inhabitants of any Village, or Hamler next the place where the robbery was done, and that if in their purſuit they take any of the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders, that ſhall excuſe them though they do not take all. See there in that Statute the reaſon of the alteration.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Co. l.</hi> 6. <hi>f.</hi> 50. <hi>a. b.</hi> At the common Law a man that had once the benefit of the Clergy, ſhall have it another time, and ſo <hi>in infinitum,</hi> which was remedied by the Act of 4 <hi>H.</hi> 7. So as the burning in the hand was not to other purpoſe, but to notifie to the Judge whether he had had his Clergy before, or no, <hi>ibid.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So if one be attainted at the Common Law for forging falſe Deeds, the King cannot pardon it, yet the King may pardon the corporall puniſhment in caſe of forgery in the Star-chamber, becauſe all Suites in the Star-chamber are but informations, for the King, though the Suit be exhibited by the party, <hi>ibidem.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So before the Statute of 18 <hi>Eliz. c.</hi> 7. the King might in caſe of Inditement of Man ſlaughter par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don the Impriſonment, 15 <hi>H.</hi> 7.9. but not in an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal, but after the Statute of 18 <hi>Eliz.</hi> by which it is provided, that after Clergy allowed and burning in the hand, the Priſoner ſhall preſently be enlarg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and delivered out of priſon: It was reſolved that that Act did extend as well to the caſe of appeal, as to the caſe of Inditements, otherwiſe the party ſhall lawfully be diſcharged of his puniſhment, and yet remain in perpetual priſon, <hi>ib. vide examen legum Angliae, f.</hi> 29.</p>

<pb n="422" facs="tcp:170097:227"/> of one Knights fee, ought to be with the King conveniently arrayed for the War, for forty daies, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yet needeth he not go with the King himſelf, if he will find another man, and this ſeemeth to be good reaſon, for it may be he is languiſhing, ſo that he cannot go, nor ride.</p>
               <p>Alſo an Abbot, or another man of religion, or a Feme-ſole which hold by ſuch ſervices, ought not go in proper perſon, <hi>Littleton ibidem. Quia multa, In jure communi, propter rationabilem cauſam, omittenda ſunt,</hi> for many things for a reaſonable cauſe are to be omitted.</p>
               <p>If the King give lands to an Abbot, and his Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors to hold by Knights ſervice, this had been good, and ſhall do homage and fine a man, but there was no wardſhip or releif, or other incident belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereunto: but if the Abbot and his Heirs had conveyed the land to a natural man and his heirs, now the wardſhip, releif, or other incident belonged of common right to the King. So if the King give lands to a Mayor and Comminalty, and their ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors to be holden in Knights-ſervice, the Patentee ſhall do no homage, neither ſhall there be any wardſhip, or releif, onely they ſhall find a man, but if they convey the land to any naturall man and his heirs, now marriage, homage, ward, releif, or other incidents belong hereunto; for the reaſon of the Law being changed, the Law its ſelf is changed, and the immunity which was in reſpect of the body politique, by conveyance over, ceaſeth, <hi>Coke ibid.</hi>

As if a man make a Leaſe of Indenture for life of lands in ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Counties, and maketh livery of ſeiſin in one County, and divers daies after he maketh livery in the other County, yet an intire rent ſhall iſſue out of the land in both Counties, and yet the livery by which the Eſtate paſſed was made at ſeverall times, and therefore it may be argued, that preſently by
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:170097:227"/> the firſt livery the rent iſſued out of it: But the Law ſhall not adjudge by parcels, in ſubverſion of the intent and agreement of the parties, but after all Acts are made in performance of the originall contract and agreement of the parties, the Law ſhall adjudge upon all as done at one and the ſame time. So if a man make a Charter of Feoffment with war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranty, and deliver the Deed to the Feoffee, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter at another time make livery <hi>ſecundum formam chartae:</hi> yet the Warranty is good, and yet it may be objected, that when the Deed was delivered no eſtate paſſed to which the warranty may be annex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, nor no eſtate was in the Feoffee by which the Deed might enure; and ſo by nice conſtruction up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the diſtinction of time the warranty ſhall be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, but the Deed which comprehended the warranty took effect preſently by the delivery of the Deed before livery and ſeiſin, and therefore the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence is true, that who do ſeek reaſon in all things ſubvert reaſon, <hi>ibidem.</hi>

               <p>Yet the Common Law hath no controller but the high Court of Parliament, and the wiſdome and cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome of this State hath alwaies had ſuch regard and reſpect to the Common law, that they would by no meanes change it, but by the great Councell of Parliament, wherein all things are tranſacted not onely by the prudency of the Prince, but by the chei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt and ſageſt Senators of the whole Nation, and that not upon the conſultation and declaration of one or two hundred, but as <hi>Forteſcue</hi> by more, and three hundred elect men, by which number the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate of <hi>Rome</hi> was ruled, who alwaies have been cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious, and vigilant not to introduce any forrein Law, as Sir <hi>John Davis</hi> in his Preface obſerveth: That in the Parliament of <hi>Merton</hi> when motion was made by the Clergy, that Children borne be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore marriage might be adjudged legitimate.

               <p>To illuſtrate this by examples.</p>
               <p>It is regularly true, that Statutes in the affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive ſhall not take away precedent acts affirmative, unleſs it be in ſpeciall caſes.</p>
               <p>As the Statute of Wills, 32. <hi>&amp;</hi> 34 <hi>H.</hi> 8. doth not take away a cuſtome to deviſe lands as often hath been adjudged.

               </p>
               <p>So the Statute of 23 <hi>Eliz.</hi> that inflicteth the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty of twenty pounds by the moneth, hath not ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away the Statute of 1 <hi>Eliz.</hi> which hath given the forfeiture of twelve pence for every Sunday and Holy-day, but both ſhall be paid, the twelve pence onely to the poor, and the twenty pounds to the Queen, and therefore doth the Statute of 3 <hi>Jac. c.</hi> 4. give a more ſpeedy remedy for the ſaid twelve pence, yet ſhall they not be puniſhed but upon one of them.</p>
               <pb n="455" facs="tcp:170097:243"/>
               <p>Yet when the latter affirmative Statute is con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>trary to the precedent Statute in matter, the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer abrogateth the latter, as by the Statute of 33 <hi>H</hi> 8. <hi>c.</hi> 23 it is enacted, that if any perſon being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined before the Councell of the King, or three of them, ſhall confeſs any Treaſon, miſpriſion of Treaſon, or Murther, or be to them vehemently ſuſpected, he ſhall be tried in any County where the King pleaſeth by his Commiſſion, and after by the Statute of 1 <hi>&amp;</hi> 2 <hi>P.

So the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of 1 <hi>E.</hi> 6. of Chanteries being in the affirmative, doth alter the Statute of <hi>H.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 41. which giveth a <hi>Ceſſavit cantaria</hi> alſo in the affirmative, for the one is contrary to the other in matter, <hi>vide plura, Coke l.</hi> 9. <hi>f.</hi> 63. <hi>a.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But whenſoever Lawes are contrary in quality, that is, where the firſt is a materiall or expreſs affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mative, and the latter an expreſs or materiall nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, and when the firſt is a materiall or expreſs negative, and latter affirmative, there the latter Law doth abrogate the former. As the Statute of 5 <hi>E. c,</hi> 4. which prohibiteth every perſon to uſe or exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe any craft, myſtery, or occupation, unleſs he hath been an Apprentice for ſeven years, doth alter the Common Law, by which any one may in any man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner worke in any lawfull Trade, without any ſervice precedent: for without an Act of Parliament no man can be reſtrained to worke in any Trade, <hi>Coke l</hi> 11. <hi>f.</hi> 54. <hi>a.</hi> in the Taylors of <hi>Ipſiches</hi> caſe.</p>
